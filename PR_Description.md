## Sample Interaction

Here's what a typical session looks like:

```
____________________________________________________________

Hello! I'm hhvrfn
What can I do for you?
____________________________________________________________

todo read book
____________________________________________________________

 Got it. I've added this task:
   [T][ ] read book
 Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
____________________________________________________________

deadline return book /by 2019-10-15
____________________________________________________________

 Got it. I've added this task:
   [D][ ] return book (by: Oct 15 2019)
 Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
____________________________________________________________

list
____________________________________________________________

 Here are the tasks in your list:
 1. [T][ ] read book
 2. [D][ ] return book (by: Oct 15 2019)
____________________________________________________________
```

## Technical Architecture

If you are a Java programmer, you can use it to practice Java too. Here's the main method:

```java
public class Hhvrfn {
    private final Ui ui;
    private final Storage storage;
    private TaskList tasks;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Hhvrfn("./data/hhvrfn.txt").run();
    }
}
```

The application follows clean architecture principles with:

- **Separation of concerns** between `Ui`, `Parser`, `Storage`, and `TaskList`
- *Robust error handling* with custom `HhvrfnException`
- File-based persistence using a simple pipe-separated format:
  - `T | 1 | read book` (Todo task, done)
  - `D | 0 | return book | 2019-10-15` (Deadline task, not done)
  - `E | 0 | project meeting | Mon 2pm to 4pm` (Event task, not done)

## Task Types Supported

The application supports three types of tasks:

| Type | Symbol | Format | Example |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| Todo | `[T]` | `todo DESCRIPTION` | `todo read book` |
| Deadline | `[D]` | `deadline DESCRIPTION /by YYYY-MM-DD` | `deadline return book /by 2019-10-15` |
| Event | `[E]` | `event DESCRIPTION /from TIME /to TIME` | `event meeting /from 2pm /to 4pm` |
